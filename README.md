Webscraping Project
This project demonstrates the process of scraping web data (specifically hotel reviews) and performing a variety of analyses, including data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. The goal is to extract useful insights from customer reviews, helping businesses understand customer sentiments and identify trends.

Project Overview
The Webscraping project consists of several key components that work together to clean and analyze the web-scraped data. The project is divided into the following stages:

1. Web Scraping
Scraping Source: The project scrapes data from online review websites (e.g., TripAdvisor, Booking.com, etc.). Data includes customer reviews, ratings, dates, and additional meta-information.
Libraries Used: requests, beautifulsoup4 for scraping web pages, and selenium for dynamic content scraping if required.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handling Missing Data: Clean the dataset by removing rows with missing or irrelevant data.
Data Normalization: Convert date columns to appropriate formats and scale numeric data where necessary.
Text Preprocessing: Clean text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization for NLP tasks.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Exploration: Analyze the distribution of ratings, review counts, and sentiment trends over time.
Visualization: Generate bar plots, pie charts, and time-series plots to understand the patterns within the data. Libraries used include matplotlib and seaborn.
4. Sentiment Analysis
TextBlob Sentiment Analysis: The project performs sentiment analysis on the reviews to categorize each review as positive, negative, or neutral. The TextBlob library is used for this task, which provides a simple API for natural language processing.
Additional Sentiment Classifiers: If time allows, explore deeper sentiment classification models using TensorFlow or transformers (BERT).
5. Word Cloud Visualization
Frequent Terms: Create a word cloud to visualize the most frequently mentioned words across reviews. This is an effective way to see which terms are central to customers’ experiences.
Libraries Used: wordcloud, nltk.
6. Machine Learning for Sentiment Classification
Random Forest Classifier: Train a Random Forest model to classify reviews into positive or negative sentiments based on extracted features.
BERT Model: If time and resources allow, fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for better accuracy in sentiment classification using the transformers library.
7. Topic Modeling
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): Use LDA to extract latent topics from the reviews and identify the main themes that customers are discussing.
Visualize Topics: Use pyLDAvis to create an interactive visualization of the topics discovered by the model.

Setup & Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copier
git clone https://github.com/Lancineconde/Webscraping.git
2. Install the dependencies:
Use the following command to install all the required libraries:

Option 2: Run the webscrapping_final.py script from the terminal to perform all tasks in a single run.

4. Explore the Results:
The project will generate:

Sentiment analysis results for each review
A word cloud visualizing frequent terms in the reviews
Visualizations of the review ratings and sentiment distribution
Topics discovered through LDA topic modeling
